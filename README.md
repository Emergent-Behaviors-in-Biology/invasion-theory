# A Theory of Ecological Invasions and Its Implications for Eco-Evolutionary Dynamics

## Overview

This repository contains the code related to our recent work on ecological invasions and their implications for eco-evolutionary dynamics, published on arXiv. 

## Authors

- **Zhijie Feng**
- **Emmy Blumenthal**
- **Pankaj Mehta**
- **Akshit Goyal**

## Jupyter Notebooks

This repository includes four Jupyter Notebooks, each produce separate result in our work:

1. **Notebook 1: general_LV_for_figure.ipynb**
   - produces the simulation and prediction for general Lotka-Volterra models.

2. **Notebook 2: general_LV_for_data.ipynb**
   - performs data analysis and prediction for experimental ecosystem fitted with general Lotka-Volterra models.

3. **Notebook 3: general_MCRM.ipynb**
   -produces the simulation and prediction for general MacArthur Consumer Resource models.

4. **Notebook 4: MiCRM_and_evolution.ipynb**
   - produces the simulation and prediction for Microbial Consumer Resource models, in addition perform repeated invasion simulation to study evolved ecosystems.

## Data
The `data` folder in this repository is a direct copy from [DS Maynard's GitHub repository](https://github.com/dsmaynard/endpoints). It is included here solely to ensure compatibility with one of the Jupyter Notebooks, which relies on this data for analysis.
